            <p>Bobandtanner Software develops mobile apps.  Currently, we have 3 mobile apps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Square Feet Calculation Utility (iOS only)</li>
                <li>Triangle Help (iOS only)</li>
                <li>Algebra Tool Mobile (iOS and Android)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>Square Feet Calculation Utility</i> is by far the most popular.  As of February 1, 2021, a new version of <i>Square Feet Calculation Utility</i> is under development.  The old version, 1.1, was developed in 2016.  It is crashing on the new iOS, 14.  The new version of <i>Square Feet Calculation Utility</i> is written completely from scratch and will be different (and hopefully better) than the old version.</p>
            <p><i>Triangle Help</i> is a triangle solver which was developed in 2016 following <i>Square Feet Calculation Utility</i>.  It does not calculate area and it is not designed to complement <i>Square Feet Calculation Utility</i>.</p>
            <p><i>Algebra Tool</i> is a human-driven computer algegra system.  It lets the human make decisions but it does not allow mistakes.  It is difficult to use so there is <a href="#" onclick="showTutorial()">a tutorial video</a> about it.  A website version of <i>Algebra Tool</i> is available here: <a href="https://winkelmantanner.github.io/algebratool/">https://winkelmantanner.github.io/algebratool/</a>.</p>
